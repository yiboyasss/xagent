    """Refuse to serve when the live ``taskstatus`` enum's labels disagree
    with the labels ``Task.status`` is declared with.

    A no-op on every backend other than PostgreSQL: ``pg_enum`` is a
    PostgreSQL system catalog, and the other backends this repo supports
    store the ``Enum`` column as a plain string, checked at the ORM layer
    instead.

    Takes the caller's connection rather than opening its own, and runs from
    ``_initialize_database_schema`` (``models/database.py``) after
    ``try_upgrade_db`` and inside ``database_startup_lock``. Three properties
    follow from that placement and are the reason for it. A migration that
    adds a ``TaskStatus`` label via ``ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE`` has already
    run by the time this check reads the catalog, so shipping one cannot
    trip this check into a crash loop -- revision
    ``20260901_taskstatus_waiting_for_user`` is that migration for
    ``WAITING_FOR_USER``. The connection is the startup lock's
    own, so this check adds no failure mode of its own beyond the ones
    schema initialization already has. And no second backend worker can
    observe a half-initialized database while it runs.

    Unlike ``validate_builtin_public_mcp_apps`` (``builtin_mcp_registry.py``),
    which runs from the same place and only reports drift, this one raises.
    Catalog drift there is configuration that an operator can reconcile while
    the process serves; a missing enum label is a write that will fail after
    a caller already believes a status transition succeeded, so the process
    must not begin serving at all.

    Keyed on the ``tasks`` table's existence rather than on an empty live
    label set, because two different situations produce that same empty
    set and only one of them is drift. "Nothing has been created yet" is
    not; "``tasks`` is present and its ``status`` column yields no enum
    labels" is, and it stays caught: the column is gone (``DROP TYPE ...
    CASCADE`` takes the column with the type), or ``status`` is not an
    enum column at all. Both of those report every ``TaskStatus`` member
    as missing and refuse to serve, which is the direction to fail in.
    Callers that run schema creation first (the startup path does) always
    find ``tasks`` present; the guard covers a caller that passes a bind
    whose schema has not been created.

    Reads the labels off ``tasks.status``'s own type rather than off
    whichever type happens to be named ``taskstatus``. ``to_regclass``
    resolves the unqualified ``tasks`` exactly as the ``has_table("tasks")``
    guard above does, ``pg_attribute`` names the column, and ``atttypid``
    is the type that column is declared with -- one resolution, not two
    that can disagree. Matching on the type name would be the second,
    independent one: PostgreSQL resolves relation names and type names
    against ``search_path`` separately, so with ``search_path = shadow,
    public``, a ``shadow.taskstatus`` and a ``public.tasks`` whose column
    uses ``public.taskstatus`` send the two lookups to different schemas.
    A complete copy in ``shadow`` would then hide a label genuinely missing
    from the type the column uses, and an extra label on that copy would
    reject a correct deployment.

    Expected labels come from ``Task.__table__.c.status.type.enums`` --
    the ``Enum`` column's own declared labels -- rather than from
    ``{member.name for member in TaskStatus}``. Today the two sets are
    equal, because the column has no ``values_callable`` and SQLAlchemy's
    default is to persist member names. If the column is ever given a
    ``values_callable`` that persists something else (member values, for
    instance), the column's declared labels stop matching the member-name
    set, and only the column is still the live database's contract.

    # Why a column on tasks rather than an EXISTS over

    # "interaction_protocol_version is NULL -> legacy path, ask the

    # which is the only place that knows whether an active native row
    # exists". All four call sites that ask already hold a loaded Task
    # row when they need the answer, so the NULL check is a free
    # attribute access -- while an EXISTS derivation would cost one
    # cross-table query per waiting-status read, on paths that include the
    # websocket's synchronous snapshot, which asks once and reuses the
    # answer for both events it emits. The fourth call site runs in a
    # worker-owned short session of its own rather than a request-scoped
    # one, but it resolves and loads the same Task row before asking, so
    # the same free-attribute-access argument applies to it unchanged.
    # ``task_interaction_close.active_interaction_id_sync`` reads this same
    # marker too, ahead of the interaction-table query it guards, but it is
    # not one of the four above: it never holds a loaded Task row, so it
    # pays for its own single-column primary-key query rather than getting
    # the check for free. That is the trade against the alternative it
    # replaced -- an uncached catalog inspection plus a two-table join --
    # not a violation of the free-access argument above, which is about the
    # read surface specifically.
    # While every waiting task predates the native protocol (and during
    # any rollback), the marker is NULL for all of them and the
    # interaction table receives zero queries from the read path.
    #
    # Falling back to the legacy transcript is gated on the interaction

    # native row **on its current run**. As long as one active native row
    # on this task's current run holds the slot, the read surface never
    # falls back -- whether or not that row can be read. A row left
    # behind by an earlier run does not hold the slot: the read
    # surface's active-row predicate compares the row's run against the

    The column stores ``TaskStatus`` member names, not member values (see
    the ``status`` column comment). A raw string literal reaching an
    ORM/Core comparison or write fails at bind time with ``StatementError``
    wrapping ``LookupError`` (see the column comment above for why that
    holds on both backends); raw ``text()`` SQL bypasses that bind layer
    and is covered instead by the storage-layer sentinels in
    ``tests/web/services/test_task_status_storage.py``.

    A typed ``TaskStatus`` member compared directly against ``Task.status``
    is legitimate and common in this codebase; it compiles to exactly what
    the methods below compile to (pinned by the equivalence tests in
    ``test_task_status_storage.py``). The methods below are the required
    entry point for value-sourced or dynamic statuses -- anything that is
    not a literal ``TaskStatus`` member in the source -- because they turn
    a non-``TaskStatus`` input into a construction-time ``TypeError``
    instead of a query-time failure. What is actually enforced repo-wide is
    narrower still: the literal-predicate scan in
    ``tests/web/services/test_task_status_literal_predicates.py`` bans a
    raw string literal placed beside ``Task.status``; adoption of the
    methods below at the safe-but-unconverted typed sites above is not
    enforced and is not claimed.
