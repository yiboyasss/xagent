"""Single source of truth for task turn lifecycle.

Both the WebSocket UI path (``websocket.py:handle_chat_message``) and the
``/v1`` SDK endpoints (``v1/tasks.py``) route through this module. It owns
the parts of the lifecycle that *must* behave identically across both
transports so the same race / state-machine bugs don't grow back on
either side:

  - atomic state transitions (claim a task as RUNNING)
  - user message persistence (``task_chat_messages``)
  - background execution scheduling with a single-flight guard
  - assistant ``task.output`` / ``error_message`` sync after the bg
    coroutine returns

Things this module deliberately does **not** own (each transport keeps
its own adapter):

  - response shapes / error envelopes
    (``{"detail": ...}`` for ``/api/*`` vs ``{"error": {"code", "message"}}``
    for ``/v1/*``)
  - live broadcast events (WS sends ``task_started`` / ``task_completed``;
    SDK doesn't)

Background context — why we replaced the older ``task_execution.py``
helper with this orchestrator:

  - The atomic claim in ``v1/tasks.py`` previously filtered on
    ``status != RUNNING``, which let a brand-new PENDING task be
    claimed by an immediate follow-up ``POST /messages`` before the bg
    coroutine ever ran. Two bg coroutines could end up racing the same
    transcript and task.output.
  - ``background_task_manager.register_task`` overwrites the previous
    handle for a given ``task_id``. Combined with
    ``wait_for_previous``'s ``is current_task`` short-circuit, two
    concurrent kickoffs would each register themselves as "previous"
    and skip waiting. The orchestrator's ``_refuse_if_bg_inflight``
    closes this from the caller side.

Both races are prevented by funneling the WebSocket and /v1 transports
through this single turn-lifecycle chokepoint -- the atomic claim
filter and ``_refuse_if_bg_inflight`` guard close them at the
orchestrator boundary.

        Owns the full turn-start contract. The atomic write transaction
        (claim + user-message persist + commit) runs on an isolated
        worker-thread session via ``asyncio.to_thread`` so the ~5s write
        RTT does not block the asyncio event loop (issue #427). The caller
        passes primitives only; ``begin_turn`` never touches the caller's
        session, and returns a :class:`TurnStarted` snapshot the caller
        reads instead of re-fetching the ORM.

        Sequence:

          1. ``_refuse_if_bg_inflight`` — reject if a bg coroutine is still
             running for this task (``TaskTurnError("bg_inflight")``). Pure
             in-memory dict check. The process-local task controller serializes
             callers in this worker; callers in different workers can still
             both pass, so the DB atomic claim remains the authoritative
             cross-worker guard and lets exactly one win.
          2. ``_begin_turn_atomic_sync`` (off-loop): atomic claim
             (``id == task_id AND user_id == task_owner_user_id AND
             <status_filter>``) + persist + snapshot SELECT + single commit.
             By construction it only raises BEFORE commit, so a successful
             return means the row is committed RUNNING.
          3. ``_schedule_bg`` (sync, no await) — schedule the lease-aware bg
             coroutine. Once step 2 committed, this must succeed or the task
             is forced FAILED (no zombie RUNNING).

        ``task_owner_user_id`` is the task OWNER's id — the runtime identity
        the turn executes as. Callers derive it from the already-authorized
        task row (``task.user_id``) or the SDK agent's owner
        (``agent.user_id``), NOT from the acting principal. They differ when
        an admin operates on another user's task: authorization happens at
        the entry (e.g. the WS admin bypass), and the turn must still run as
        the owner, not the admin. The claim predicate keeps ``Task.user_id ==
        task_owner_user_id`` as defense-in-depth.

        ``actor_user_id`` is the acting principal that initiated the turn —
        the same as the owner for normal / SDK / workforce flows, but the
        admin's id when an admin acts on another user's task. It is recorded
        for audit/logging only and deliberately does NOT enter the claim,
        snapshot resolution, ``UserContext``, or tool config; the runtime
        always runs as ``task_owner_user_id``.

        Args:
            task_id: The committed task's id.
            task_owner_user_id: The task owner's id (runtime identity). Used
                for the claim predicate, the persisted user message, and the
                whole bg execution context.
            payload: Two-channel message (transcript + execution).
            kind: Which status filter the atomic claim uses.
            force_fresh: When True, the bg coroutine starts a fresh agent
                run (WS terminal re-engage); invalid with ``kind=CREATE``.
            context: Optional execution-context dict.

        Returns:
            :class:`TurnStarted` — committed-row snapshot
            (``status``/``updated_at``/``before_message_id``) plus the bg

    """Close a terminally settled turn's delivery row (xorbitsai/xagent-saas#332).

    A user-message delivery row is written ``pending`` with the turn claim and
    projected to ``dispatched`` right after scheduling. That projection is
    best-effort: a pool timeout or a transient DB error leaves the row
    ``pending`` even though the turn ran. Nothing else on the orchestrator path
    advances it, so the session WS dedup probe classifies every
    same-``client_message_id`` retry as an in-flight ``PENDING`` and rejects it
    forever.

    Reconciling at finalize closes that window for every turn that reaches a
    terminal lease settlement owned by its coroutine. The call is intentionally
    skipped — leaving the row ``pending`` — when the coroutine is not the
    authoritative closer: the lease went to another worker, settlement was
    deferred to TTL recovery or raised, the settle was fenced out / superseded
    (returned ``False``), or the pre-execution SETTLEMENT_READY short-circuit
    fired. A hard process crash skips it too. Of those leftovers, only the
    paused-task resume path has an in-repo consumer that re-posts the same
    ``turn_id``; ``task_lease_recovery`` terminalizes the *task* but never
    redrives the turn or touches delivery rows, so the deferral/crash cases
    remain a narrower instance of the stuck-``pending`` window, not a solved
    one.

    Target selection is driven by what finalize actually knows, because the
    downstream contract is asymmetric: the session WS probe answers a
    ``failed`` row with ``retry_with_new_id`` — an invitation to re-send the
    same content — so ``failed`` is only safe with positive evidence the
    message was never consumed.

    - ``settlement_error is None`` → ``completed``: the run returned without
      raising. Note this does not certify success — ``execute_task_background``
      may set ``task.status = FAILED`` internally and return normally, leaving
      ``settlement_error`` unset — but both ``completed`` and ``dispatched``
      read identically downstream ("delivered, do not retry"), so the
      distinction has no client-visible effect.
    - error and ``execution_started`` → ``dispatched``: the run may have
      consumed the message (and produced side effects) before failing, so the
      one certain fact is "no longer in flight". A retry invitation here would
      double-execute the turn. The probe treats ``dispatched`` as delivered;
      the turn's failure is surfaced through task status, not by reopening
      delivery. This also removes the timing asymmetry with the post-schedule
      projection: whichever best-effort write lands, the row converges on
      ``dispatched``.
    - error and not ``execution_started`` → ``failed``:
      ``execute_task_background`` was never invoked (setup failed, or the run
      was cancelled first), so the message was provably never consumed and a
      fresh-id retry is safe. The accepted cost is that the ``failed`` row
      remains visible in the transcript (no history-loading path filters on
      ``delivery_status``), so a fresh-id resend can show the user's message
      twice — a pre-existing property of every ``failed`` writer, tracked in
      xorbitsai/xagent-saas#417, and strictly better than wedging the client
      on a ``pending`` row forever.

    The transition is monotonic — it never regresses — but only ``completed``
    and ``failed`` are terminal: ``dispatched`` still has an outgoing edge to
    ``completed``, which is how a turn that failed its projection but later
    settles cleanly still closes. An already-terminal row, or a ``dispatched``
    row on a later failure, is left untouched. The final delivery state is NOT
    a proxy for the turn's outcome: it answers "may this client_message_id be
    retried?", never "did the turn succeed?".

    is intentionally retained for TTL recovery; this function never creates an
    ownerless RUNNING task.

    ``turn_id``, when given, pops that turn's ephemeral connector secrets the
    moment this call itself commits a genuine FAILED transition - using the
    same row this decision is made from, not a separate later read (see
    ``finish_turn``'s matching ``turn_id`` handling for the reconciliation
    path, which is where every other outcome, including this one when
    ``error_message`` is ``None``, gets the same treatment).

    Called from ``_schedule_bg._runner`` after ``execute_task_background``
    returns. Two key properties:

      - latest-turn snapshot invariant: COMPLETED, FAILED, and the
        RUNNING-fallback branch all leave the row in a state where the
        terminal field that *doesn't* apply to the current turn is
        cleared (COMPLETED clears ``error_message``; FAILED clears
        stale ``output``). SDK consumers reading ``/v1/chat/tasks/{id}``
        therefore never see a contradictory snapshot like
        ``status='failed' + output='prior successful answer'``.
      - lease ownership guard: orchestrated callers provide the concrete
        ``TaskLease``. Every read and final write is then fenced by both
        ``runner_id`` and ``run_id``; an old coroutine cannot touch a newer
        run claimed by the same process-global runner id.

    Branches:

      - ``status == COMPLETED``: set ``output`` from latest assistant
        message, clear ``error_message``
      - ``status == FAILED``: set ``error_message`` placeholder if
        absent, clear stale ``output``
      - ``status == RUNNING`` + other worker holds live lease: skip
        entirely (ownership guard)
      - ``status == RUNNING`` + we own lease or it's expired: flip to
        FAILED, set placeholder ``error_message``, clear stale
        ``output``
      - other statuses (PAUSED / WAITING_FOR_USER): control status and
        ``output`` are preserved; the lease release clears any stale
        ``error_message`` left by an earlier failed attempt

    ``turn_id``, when given, pops that turn's ephemeral connector secrets
    (see ``connector_runtime.store_ephemeral_runtime_values``) from exactly
    the COMPLETED, FAILED, and RUNNING-fallback branches above - the ones
    that read this same already-fenced ``fresh.status`` as genuinely
    terminal. This is the sole place that decides both things, so there is
    no separate later read of the row to race against a fast concurrent
    resume: the live-other-owner skip (this coroutine is not the one
    settling the turn) never pops or renews. The PAUSED / WAITING_FOR_USER
    branch instead renews the same secrets' TTL - it is the same turn
    resuming later under this same turn_id, now carrying a fresh interaction
    lifetime of its own, so its secrets must not expire on the original
    pause's clock.

    Synchronous: it defines ``_runner``, schedules it via
    ``asyncio.create_task``, registers the handle and returns it — there is
    no ``await`` at this level (every await lives inside ``_runner``, which
    runs later as its own task). Being sync removes a misleading
    suspension/cancellation point right after ``begin_turn``'s claim commit.

    Owns the full lease lifecycle for the bg run:

      - primary turn claims supply the exact lease committed with the turn
        state. Delayed execution validates that same run/runner fence before
        doing local work. Legacy ``schedule_existing`` callers acquire at
        ``_runner`` entry instead. If another worker already owns the task,
        the scheduler returns without invoking ``execute_task_background`` or
        ``finish_turn``.
      - heartbeat alongside the run.
      - release in ``finally`` as the single owner of the release call when
        execution returns normally or raises a non-pool error.
        ``execute_task_background`` only writes ``task.status`` and never
        touches the lease columns; the scheduler is responsible for the whole
        lease lifecycle. A SQLAlchemy pool checkout timeout is the deliberate
        exception: heartbeat stops, the exact lease remains intact, and TTL
        recovery reconciles it without an immediate second checkout.

    Takes primitives only (``task_id`` / ``task_owner_user_id`` /
    ``task_source``); the
    bg run loads its own snapshot and opens its own sessions, so no
    caller-bound ORM object crosses into the coroutine.
