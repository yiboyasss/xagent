    ``description`` is not in admin_mcp's _BUILTIN_PROTECTED_FIELDS, so an

    Only overwrite when the persisted value still equals the last-known
    canonical value (i.e. it was never customized); an edited value matches
    neither the previous nor the current canonical value and is left alone
    in either direction.

    ``description`` is also excluded from builtin_mcp_registry.py's own
    _BUILTIN_EXECUTION_FIELD_NAMES drift sync (unlike oauth_scopes/
    launch_config/etc., which self-heal on every read), and the seed
    migration (20260826_seed_deputy_mcp_app.py) only ever inserts a row
    once -- so without this migration, an already-provisioned install's
    deputy row would keep showing the pre-write-tools description forever,
