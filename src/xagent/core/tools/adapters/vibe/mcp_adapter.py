    function exists: ``ToolAnnotations`` declares ``bool | None`` under
    non-strict Pydantic validation, so by the time a parsed object is in
    hand, ``1`` and ``"true"`` have already become an indistinguishable
    Python ``True``. Classifying after that boundary cannot tell a server
    that promised ``true`` from one that sent a coercible non-boolean, which
    would turn "only an exact boolean counts" into a promise this code does
    not keep.

    Fail-closed in both directions that matter:

    * A declared ``destructiveHint`` outranks a simultaneous ``readOnlyHint``.
      The schema marks the two independent with no mutual exclusion, so a peer
      can send both, and the safe reading of a contradiction is the one that
      keeps a human in front of the action.
    * Everything else -- absent, ``None``, ``false``, a non-boolean, or an
      annotations value that is not even a mapping -- is ``UNDECLARED``,
      which a consumer must treat as a write.

    None of this makes the result trustworthy: annotations come from a server
    the client does not control, and the spec says outright that a client
    "should never make tool use decisions based on ToolAnnotations received
    from untrusted servers". What this buys is that a *malformed* or

    The consumer is the same-turn duplicate-write guard, whose enrollment
    question is not "may this destroy data" but "does repeating this call

    schema that is ``idempotentHint`` (``false`` = repeats have additional
    effect), not ``destructiveHint`` (``false`` = only additive updates) — a
    well-annotated create tool is additive and non-idempotent, i.e.
    ``destructiveHint: false, idempotentHint: false``.

    Reads the wire mapping for the same reason ``classify_write_hint`` does:
    only an exact boolean is a declaration. True exactly when

    Everything else is False. An absent hint is never read through its
    spec default: ``idempotentHint``'s default of false does not enroll an
    unannotated tool, and ``destructiveHint``'s default of true does not
    either, so enrollment always needs at least one exact boolean from the
    server and legitimate identical-args poll loops stay unguarded. Within
    an explicit ``destructiveHint: true``, though, a *missing*
    ``idempotentHint`` does enroll: the server declared a write and said
    nothing about repeats, which is the same reading the previous
    destructive-only enrollment used. Unlike confirmation-style
    consumers, deduplication fails OPEN: a contradictory or malformed claim

    Exception messages that legitimately need to name the server sometimes
    embed the full request URL -- e.g. ``httpx.HTTPStatusError``'s message
    is "... for url '<url>'" and an unfollowed redirect's message names the
    ``Location`` response header. Connector URLs commonly carry secrets
    (API keys, tokens) in the query string or in ``user:pass@host``
    userinfo, so those parts are dropped before the message is logged, and
    so is the fragment (it never reaches a server and carries no diagnostic
    value). The scheme, host, port, and path are kept so the log line still
    says which server failed. A token that fails to parse as a URL, or
    whose authority does not parse as ``host[:port]``, is replaced
    wholesale with ``<url redacted>`` rather than risking a partial leak.
    Two further rules cover userinfo that lost its ``@``, which no
    authority parse can recognise on its own because ``user:pass`` is
    byte-for-byte a legal ``host:port``. First, a token that still carries
    an ``@`` the parsed authority does not -- a password containing ``?``
    or ``#`` pushes the separator into the query string -- is replaced
    wholesale: the stray ``@`` is the only evidence left that the
    authority is a remnant. Second, a caller that truncates the text it
    passes here must append ``_TEXT_TRUNCATION_MARK``, because a cut can
    remove the ``@`` outright and leave no evidence at all inside the
    token; a token carrying the mark was cut at an unknown offset and is
    likewise replaced wholesale. What is still kept is an authority with
    no such evidence against it: ``https://alice:12345`` standing alone in
    an untruncated message is indistinguishable from a host named
    ``alice`` on port 12345, and rejecting it would reject every legal
    ``host:port``. ``ws://``/``wss://`` tokens are covered the same way as
    ``http``/``https``, because a websocket transport cannot send headers,
    so a websocket connector has nowhere but the URL to put its credential.
    Sentence punctuation that trails the token (a closing paren, a period,
    ...) is split off before parsing and re-appended to the result
    afterwards, so redaction does not eat the punctuation that follows a
    URL -- but only punctuation trailing the scheme/authority/path:
    nothing at or after the first ``?``/``#`` is ever treated as trailing,
    since that is where the query string / fragment begins and both are
    dropped wholesale (see ``_split_url_token``). Text separated from the
    URL only by a character that is legal inside a query string (a comma,
    say) is still part of the token and is dropped with the query; see
    the ``comma-inside-query`` test case.

        The metadata is attached to the field's annotation rather than placed
        beside the field. For an optional field Pydantic emits an ``anyOf``
        wrapper, and a consumer that resolves that wrapper down to its
        non-null branch keeps only what that branch holds; metadata placed
        beside the wrapper would be dropped there, which is exactly the shape
